## How to add a new language for Pilas Bloques?

First, clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ingridc/pilas-bloques.git
```
Then, follow the steps found in the README.md file of the project.

Once the dependencies have been installed, you must generate the local files for the new language. For example, if you want to add the French language, the command to execute would be the following:
```sh
ember generate locale fr
```
This action generates the translations.js file where the translations must be performed.
